		<h3>Goal: to keep the player from falling by jumping on the platforms and to keep the player from colliding into moving obstacles</h3>
		<h3>How to play:</h3>
		<h4>Control the player with the left and right arrow keys to try and land the player on a platform before it falls. <br>The player will jump automatically. <br>If the player cannot find a platform to jump on in time
			<br>or if the player collides with a moving obstacle, it will die. <br>If the player contacts a moving obstacle while it is falling, <br>the player will use the obstacle as a platform to jump up and the obstacle will disappear.
			<br>If the player's jumping height is too low for the closest platform, <br>stay on the current platform and wait for a few seconds for a suitable altitude. <br>However, the altitude wont gain forever and will drop once it reaches 
			<br>its maximum altitude for 1-3 times. Good luck!
